	<h2>3.	How and why we may store and use your information</h2>
	<p>Accountable (or third party data processors acting on our behalf) may collect, store and use your personal information listed above for the following purposes, listed below.</p>
	
	<h3>3.1	Legal obligation</h3>
	<p>Accountable is bound by a number of legal and regulatory obligations that require the processing of your personal data. These obligations may imply that Accountable collaborates with the relevant authorities and/or with third parties and, where appropriate, provides them with some of your data in light of:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>the obligation to respond to the official requests of the various competent authorities (for example in the field of data protection, consumer protection, etc.), whether Belgian or foreign; and</li>
		<li>the obligation to respond to requests from Belgian or foreign judicial authorities;</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>Accountable collects certain personal data that it obtains from You in order to comply with legal taxing obligations as mandated by you for providing you with the Tax and Accounting services.</p>
	
	<h3>3.2	Use of the Application App</h3>
	<p>Accountable collects some personal data from You to make the Accountable Application available to You and to provide you with content which is tailored to your individual situation. Specifically to:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>assist you in the online registration process, in providing information about our services and terms of use;</li>
		<li>the management of your user account;</li>
		<li>provide you with the services relating to the Accountable Application that you request, in particular to capture and assess transactions in order to manage your accounting and tax obligations as requested;</li>
		<li>answer your questions and requests;</li>
	</ul>
	
	<h3>3.3	Legitimate interests</h3>
	<p>Accountable also processes your data for the realization of its legitimate interests. To that end, Accountable strives to maintain a balance between the need to process data and respect for your rights and freedoms, including the protection of privacy.</p>
	<p>Your data is processed for:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>the retaining of evidence (archiving);</li>
		<li>the operation, evaluation and improvement of the quality of services rendered to users;</li>
		<li>the management of our communications with you;</li>
		<li>facilitate the functionality of the Application and the Site;</li>
		<li>the preparation of studies, models (risk, marketing and others) and statistics, using techniques of anonymisation and/or pseudonymisation of the persons concerned;</li>
		<li>the use of cookies to improve the Application and the Site (see Cookie policy);</li>
		<li>the recognition, exercise, defense and preservation of Accountable's rights;</li>
	</ul>
	
	<h3>3.4	Direct Marketing</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>[where you have given us your consent, to contact You (including by SMS and e-mail) with products and services which we think may interest You; and</li>
		<li>[where you have given us your consent, to disclose your personal information to carefully chosen third parties so that they may contact You (including by SMS and e-mail) with products and services which they think may interest You.]</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>Accountable perfectly understands that sharing access to professional bank transactions and, in some cases, bank credentials, while necessary for the performance of the services, needs to be handled with care.</p>
	
	<p>Apart from a legal basis, in a true effort of transparency, we set up a strong and explicit consent management workflow, built directly in the application: during the sign-up, the user is presented with screen that explicit what is required from him, for which purpose and what are the policies in place to protect his data.</p>
	
	<p>Here are a few examples of how We deliver such screens:</p>

	<caption>Consent management illustration</caption>

	<h2>4.	Data Subjects rights</h2>
	<p>As a user of the Accountable Application and processing of your data, you have the following rights:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>the right to ask us to provide you with copies of personal information that we hold about you at any time;</li>
